# Privacy Policy

Effective date: February 10, 2026

Sorcerer Trading ("we," "us," or "our") provides an embedded wallet and trading interface for the Solana network. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

## Summary
- We do not collect seed phrases, private keys, or passwords.
- We do not require an account to use the app.
- We only use public blockchain data and the wallet public address you connect.
- If you contact support, we use your email to respond.

## Information We Collect
### Public blockchain data
When you connect a wallet, we use your public wallet address and public on-chain transaction data to show balances, positions, and activity. This information is public on the Solana blockchain.

### Support communications
If you contact us (for example, by email), we collect the information you provide so we can respond. This usually includes your email address and the contents of your message.

## Information We Do Not Collect
- Seed phrases, private keys, or wallet passwords
- Payment card information
- Precise device location
- Advertising identifiers or cross-app tracking data

## How We Use Information
We use the information described above to:
- Provide and operate the app and its features
- Display on-chain balances and activity
- Respond to support requests
- Maintain security and prevent abuse

## Sharing of Information
We do not sell your personal information. We only share information:
- When required by law or to comply with legal process
- To protect the security and integrity of the app

We do not share or sell wallet public addresses for advertising.

## Data Retention
- Public blockchain data is retained on the blockchain and is not controlled by us.
- Support emails are retained only as long as needed to resolve the request or comply with legal obligations.

## Embedded Wallets
The app uses embedded wallets. This means your in-app wallet private key is not accessible within the app. Wallet creation and key management are handled by our wallet provider.

## Security
We use reasonable measures to protect the information we handle. You are responsible for safeguarding access to your device and app.

## International Users
If you access the app from outside your country, you understand that information may be processed in jurisdictions where we or our service providers operate.

## Children's Privacy
The app is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the effective date at the top of this page.
